# SEAM: A Stochastic Benchmark for Multi-Document Tasks

## Download the data
Some of the datasets included in SEAM can be reached via huggingface datasets (FuseReviews, MultiNews, Scico). 

For the rest of the datasets, please download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H6pBzwJmCfFGOWOOzyLDFID2lIk9bbfI/view?usp=share_link) the zip containing the data and unzip it before generating a benchmark instance.

The path where you unzip the data should appear in the configuration file as examplified in the `files/configuration/generate.json` file (it should be filled within the `path` field for each dataset among MusiQue, ECB, and OpenASP).
