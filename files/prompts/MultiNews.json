Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich declared on Fox News that if Mollie Tibbetts is a household name by October, Democrats will be in deep trouble come Election Day. In the Tibbetts case, Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, was charged with first-degree murder Tuesday after the body of 20-year-old Tibbetts was found in a field east of her hometown, Brooklyn, Iowa. In a court filing ahead of Rivera's first court appearance on Wednesday, his lawyer, Allan Richards, sought a gag order claiming that the federal government was promoting the idea that his client was in the country illegally. Cristhian Rivera, 24, accused of killing University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts, is led from the courtroom after making his initial appearance on a charge of first-degree murder during at the Poweshiek County Courthouse in Montezuma, Iowa. And in an interview with NBC News on Thursday, Richards was evasive when asked for proof that Rivera was in the U.S. legally.",

In the fall of 2016, Canopy, which trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker WEED, became the first company in the marijuana industry to achieve elusive unicorn status. Canadians have enjoyed the ability to possess and grow small amounts of weed for medical use. In 2014, the government began licensing companies like Canopy to produce mass amounts of marijuana for patients suffering from serious diseases.

Canopy already exports marijuana products to Germany and Brazil. “We’re thrilled to be marketing WEED on Bay Street,” Chief Executive Officer Bruce Linton said in a statement.",

Canopy CEO Bruce Linton has ambitious expansion plans for the company as it grows internationally and Canada inches closer to full legalization of the drug that’s now allowed for medical use.

		"Darden Restaurants, owner of the Italian restaurant chain Olive Garden, says its unlimited breadsticks and salad dressings are working out just fine with consumers. The casual-dining restaurant operator is on the defensive after investor Starboard Value LP last week disclosed nearly 300-page slide presentation that detailed a potential turnaround plan for Darden’s Olive Garden chain. Among the complaints: Olive Garden was serving too many breadsticks, adding too much dressing to its salads, and not serving enough alcohol. Among the most egregious complaints: Starboard lamented Olive Garden wasn’t adding salt to the water used to cook the pasta, asking How does the largest Italian dining concept in the world not salt the water for pasta? Darden fired back this week, saying in a 24-page slide presentation that Starboard’s suggestions are not based on reality.",

The remark is part of a response by the chain's parent company, Darden Restaurants Inc., to a nearly 300-page criticism released by hedge fund Starboard Value last week. Starboard took Olive Garden and its management to task for a variety of issues, including its liberal distribution of breadsticks, its failure to salt the water used to boil its pasta, and even the length of the asparagus it serves. Darden's 24-page response states that the company is already implementing a variety of strategies to improve Olive Garden's performance. Starboard is lobbying to gain control of Darden's board of directors at the company's annual meeting which is based in Orlando, Florida, has struggled to boost sales at Olive Garden with the growing popularity of chains such as Chipotle. Under pressure to boost results, Darden recently sold off Red Lobster, which was doing even worse than Olive Garden. As for its breadsticks, Starboard said last week that Olive Garden was being wasteful because servers weren't sticking to the policy of providing one breadstick per customer, plus an extra for the table.

		"Nearly 300 aviation security officers are suing the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois, asserting that they were wrongfully stripped of their law enforcement status following the widely publicized incident involving Dr. David Dao being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight in April 2017. These officers, recognized as law enforcement since 1993 and trained at the Chicago Police Academy or the Cook County Sheriff’s Training Academy, lost their privileges due to political pressure after the incident. The city’s Aviation Commissioner and the state board declared that aviation officers were no longer considered law enforcement at airports. The officers' lawsuit contends that removing their law enforcement status unfairly impacts their work history and future job opportunities.",

He claims he was not properly trained on the use of force, which he argues contributed to the incident involving Dr. David Dao. Dr. Dao was forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight, resulting in significant injuries, and later settled with the airline. The incident led to a policy change by United Airlines regarding the allocation of seats to crew members. But for the CDA's negligence and failure to train Long how to respond to an escalating situation with an Airline Passenger, he would not have acted in the manner he did, which resulted in his termination, the complaint says, according to newspaper"

In the lawsuit, James Long argues that United should have known that calling security to remove David Dao, 69, from the overbooked flight would require the use of physical force. The complaint also states that although Long completed five months of training as a police recruit, the Chicago Department of Aviation failed to provide training on the level of force continuum. With that training. In a separate lawsuit, some 300 aviation security officers are suing Chicago and the state of Illinois, complaining that they were stripped of their law enforcement officer status after the Dao incident, the Chicago Tribune reports.

        "Local and international human rights groups have criticized Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque for claiming they are manipulated by drug lords to oppose the Duterte administration's drug policies. Human Rights Watch described these allegations as government intimidation tactics meant to undermine Philippine human rights activists who challenge the administration's approach to the rule of law and potential crimes against humanity. Roque defended his statements, suggesting that such groups should not overreact and politicize the issue for media attention. Meanwhile, the local group Karapatan accused the administration of fabricating stories to blame human rights organizations for its failures in addressing the drug problem and for tarnishing the nation’s reputation. They suggest that these accusations serve to justify attacks on activists or to dodge accountability under domestic and international rights laws. Despite official figures indicating over 4000 deaths in drug operations, human rights organizations estimate the toll could be as high as 13,000.",
        "Philippine law enforcement agencies still have no proof yet on allegations made by two government officials that human rights groups may have become the “unwitting tools” of drug lords, police and drug enforcement agency officials said on Tuesday. Carreon said more than 123,000 drug suspects had been arrested, which he said showed anti-drugs operations were not about killings. He said law enforcement agencies welcomed any criticism from rights groups and allowed them to observe anti-drug operations to prove that everything was done according to the rule of law. Duterte’s spokesman and foreign secretary did not present any evidence when they told reporters drug lords were using human rights groups to undermine the policy, statements against which the Human Rights Watch protested and said were “shameful” and risked provoking violence. The anti-narcotics campaign has raised international alarm and drawn criticism from some U.N. representatives."

      "target": "Human rights groups in the Philippines are contending with government claims that they are inadvertently assisting drug lords by highlighting the increasing number of deaths in President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war. Following a particularly violent week where 13 people were killed in one night, presidential spokesman Harry Roque accused these groups of hindering the government's efforts. This aligns with earlier statements from Foreign Secretary Alan Cayetano, who criticized the motives of these groups. Despite official reports of around 4,100 deaths in police shootouts and 124000 arrests since June 2016, human rights organizations argue that the actual death toll is significantly higher and that the government's accusations aim to diminish their credibility and ignore global criticism of Duterte's policies. The International Criminal Court is investigating these policies as potential crimes against humanity. Human Rights Watch described Roque's comments as dangerously misleading, and local group Karapatan criticized the government for fabricating stories to malign them."
