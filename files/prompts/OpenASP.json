        "Perry: Good enough debater to beat Obama Rick Perry reiterated his frustration Sunday with a presidential nominating process that puts too much emphasis on debate performance, the morning after his campaign confirmed that he will attend at least five more in his bid for the Republican nomination. The Texas governor said 18 debates is way too many because they take an incredible amount of time and preparation. When you take a look at the debates, I readily admit I'm not the best debater, he said on Fox News Sunday. With as many debates as we've got coming up, I may be a pretty good debater before it's all said and done. We've got a great debater, a smooth politician, in the White House right now. That's not what we want right now, Perry said. The governor said he's confident he can draw a clear bright line if he is debating President Barack Obama during the general election. I think I am going to be able to stand on that stage and draw a clear contrast with Barack Obama, he said.",

Two-and-a-half million jobs is terrible, the host told the Republican presidential candidate. We would roughly need 6 million jobs in the first four years just to stay even with population growth. So two-and-a-half-million jobs, the unemployment rate would increase! Jimmy Carter created 10.5 million jobs in his first four years. Perry said he would get criticized for not being realistic if he said he was going to create 10.5 million jobs. Let me tell you, any job at this particular point in time helps, he said. Wallace said the national unemployment rate would increase if Perry merely met the goal he set. You give this plan a chance, Perry told him, live in Austin."
